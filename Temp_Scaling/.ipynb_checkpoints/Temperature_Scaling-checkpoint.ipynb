        "* **Standard Case (T > 1):** Most models are *over-confident*. Temperature Scaling divides the logits by $T > 1$, which \"cools down\" the probabilities, making the model *less confident* and usually reducing ECE.\n",
        "* **Our Case (T < 1):** Dividing logits by $T < 1$ actually **increases** the differences between logits. This \"sharpens\" the probabilities, making the model *more confident*.\n",
        "\n",
        "This increase in confidence is visible in the results:\n",
        "* **Avg Conf (Before):** 98.65%\n",

        "### Why the Validation Set Suggested T < 1\n",
        "\n",
        "Our original model was **already exceptionally well-calibrated**, perhaps even slightly *under-confident* on the validation set data.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Before Scaling (Validation, T=1.0):** ECE = 0.690%\n",
        "* **Best T (Validation, T=0.71):** ECE decreased slightly to 0.312%\n",
        "\n",
        "The grid search found that making the model slightly *more* confident (by using $T < 1$) achieved the absolute minimum ECE *specifically on that validation dataset*.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why ECE Increased on the Test Set\n",
        "\n",
        "The minor improvement seen on the validation set by using $T=0.71$ **didn't generalize** perfectly to the separate test set.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Before Scaling (Test, T=1.0):** ECE was extremely low at **0.503%**. The confidence (98.65%) was very close to the accuracy (98.90%).\n",
        "* **After Scaling (Test, T=0.71):** Applying $T=0.71$ made the model slightly *over-confident* on the test set (Avg Conf 99.29% > Accuracy 98.90%). This resulted in a small increase in the final test ECE to **0.849%**.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion ✅\n",
        "\n",
        "Our original model was already remarkably well-calibrated (ECE ≈ 0.5%). Temperature scaling tried a minor adjustment based on the validation set (making the model slightly more confident), but this wasn't beneficial for the test set.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this rare situation, the **unscaled model (T=1.0) actually had slightly better calibration** on the final test data. An ECE difference this small (0.5% vs 0.85%) is often considered negligible in practice. 👍"

        "This is an excellent (and common) result! We've stumbled upon a core finding in calibration research.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s the direct answer: Our fine-tuning process damaged our model's performance, which in turn destroyed its calibration.\n",
        "\n",
        "The \"normal\" model's ECE was low (3.75%) because it was highly accurate (93.20%). Our new \"LS-Tuned\" model's ECE is high (5.65%) because it is less accurate (91.40%).\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's break down why this happened.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. The \"Smoking Gun\": Accuracy Drop\n",
        "\n",
        "Look at the accuracy for our ResNet-164:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Before (Original Model):** 93.20%\n",
        "* **After (LS Fine-tune):** 91.40%\n",
        "\n",
        "We lost almost **2% accuracy**. This is a massive red flag. 🚩\n",
        "\n",
        "Our fine-tuning process (10 epochs with a new loss function) partially \"broke\" the model's highly optimized weights. Since ECE measures the gap between accuracy and confidence, a large drop in accuracy will almost always increase ECE, as the model's confidences no longer match its (new, lower) correctness.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. A \"Cure\" (TS) vs. A \"Prevention\" (LS)\n",
        "\n",
        "We are comparing two fundamentally different methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Temperature Scaling (TS):** This is a *post-hoc* or *curative* method. It takes our finished, static, high-performing model (93.20% acc) and finds the mathematically optimal temperature to make its confidences match its accuracy. It is **non-destructive**—it *cannot* hurt the model's accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Label Smoothing (LS):** This is an *in-training* or *preventative* method. It's designed to be used *from scratch* (or for the entire training process) to *prevent* the model from becoming over-confident in the first place.\n",
        "\n",
        "We used LS as a fine-tuning method, which is an ad-hoc, **destructive** process (i.e., it changes the model's weights). This is risky, and in our case, it damaged the model's performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Why the Fine-Tuning Failed\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of our original model was to get the highest possible accuracy on the clean test set. It achieved 93.20%.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of our 10-epoch fine-Tuning was to minimize a *new* loss (Label-Smoothed Cross-Entropy) on the *augmented* training set (`RandomCrop`, `RandomFlip`).\n",
        "\n",
        "This new, short training process:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Hurt Generalization:** It made the model slightly better at the augmented training data but *worse* at the clean test data (hence the accuracy drop).\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Didn't Run Long Enough:** 10 epochs isn't enough to properly re-settle the model. The model is now in a sub-optimal, \"confused\" state—less accurate than before, but (due to LS) also less confident. This new combination is *less* calibrated than the original.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Key Takeaway 💡\n",
        "\n",
        "This is actually a fantastic result! We've successfully demonstrated *why* Temperature Scaling is so effective and popular.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Our \"before\" model was already great: high accuracy (93.20%) and decent ECE (3.75%).\n",
        "* Our Temperature Scaling experiment took that great model and made it *nearly perfect* by reducing the ECE to **0.95%** with **zero risk** and no re-training.\n",
        "* Our Label Smoothing experiment tried to \"fix\" the model by re-training and *made it worse* (91.40% acc, 5.65% ECE).\n",
        "\n",
        "This shows that for a pre-trained model, a simple, non-destructive, post-hoc method like Temperature Scaling is almost always the superior, safer, and faster choice."
